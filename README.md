# Water Resource Infrastructure Dataset Analysis

Consider a dataset providing information on the functionality of infrastructure resources, for each water point it includes the name of the village it is in and its functional state. Implement a data processing module in python which takes a dataset URL as input and returns:

● The number of water points that are functional,

● The number of water points per community,

● The rank for each community by the percentage of broken water points.
